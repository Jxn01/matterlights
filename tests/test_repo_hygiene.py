"""Nothing secret-shaped may be tracked by git.

🚨 **A `.gitignore` entry of `.env` does not cover `.env.bak-040827`.**

On 2026-09-10 a timestamped backup of the live `.env` -- carrying a working
183-character Home Assistant long-lived access token -- was committed and pushed
to this repository while it was public. The ignore rule said `.env`, which is an
exact filename match, so every derivative walked straight past it: `.env.bak-*`,
`.env.local`, `.env.prod`. The rule is now `.env.*` with a `!.env.example`
negation, and this test is the thing that fails if it ever narrows again.

It checks the two independent ways a secret gets in: by **filename** (a file that
is obviously a credential store) and by **content** (a token-shaped string in a
file nobody thought of as a credential store).

**It is a `unittest.TestCase`, not bare pytest functions,** because the
documented command is `python -m unittest discover -s tests` and that command
does not see pytest functions at all. As first written, this file ran zero tests
under it and the suite still said OK: a guard the documented command skips
guards nothing. pytest collects a `TestCase` just the same.

**On the patterns being built by concatenation:** a literal JWT prefix written
out in this file would be found by this file's own sweep, and the test would fail
forever on itself. Same class as ``pgrep -f`` matching the shell that runs it.
Assembling the needle at runtime means it never exists contiguously on disk.
